/**
 * Form theme presets — SunBiz-branded looks for the public form page.
 *
 * Replaces the raw branding JSON textarea with a picker. Each theme maps
 * to a FormBranding object (primary_color, accent_color, headline style).
 * The names mirror the layout HTML files in ~/SunBiz-Agent/docs/ so the
 * operator can mentally connect the form page to the marketing surfaces
 * they already know.
 *
 * Outreach + email-only templates from that repo (ads, consolidation_blast,
 * grid_* campaigns, urgency_fast_funding, social_proof_testimonial) are
 * deliberately excluded — they're not form layouts and including them
 * would confuse operators who just want a clean intake form.
