/**
 * sunbiz-default-sequences.ts — the 5 starter drip sequences for new
 * SunBiz tenants (Phase 4.5 of the SunBiz CRM build).
 *
 * These match the cadence Jordan + CC locked in at the 2026-05-15
 * meeting. They get inserted into drip_sequences when a SunBiz tenant
 * is provisioned via /api/onboarding/wizard or directly by Bravo. The
 * operator can edit / disable / delete any of them from /sequences.
 *
 * Why seed defaults instead of leaving the tenant empty:
 *   - SunBiz funding ops can't function without follow-up cadence.
 *     Forcing every new tenant to design their own drips from scratch
 *     means real leads ghost the pipeline while the operator figures
 *     out the JSON.
 *   - The seeded drips are tuned for the meeting-agreed lead.stage +
 *     offer.stage enums (Phase 2) so they fire end-to-end from day 1.
 *
 * Cadence and copy are deliberately conservative:
 *   - Cooldowns leave room for the operator to layer manual touches
 *   - "Solara" / "Helios" sender labels match SunBiz's agent personas
 *   - Plain text only; no HTML / images / links beyond simple URLs
 *   - All copy is meeting-tested wording from Text Torrent existing
 *     usage, not freshly-AI-generated cold-email-school filler
