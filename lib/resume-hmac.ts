/**
 * resume-hmac.ts — Phase H of giggly-reef.
 *
 * The Anthropic tool_use_pending pause hands a `resume_state` payload to the
 * browser, which posts it back to /api/chat/resume to continue the model
 * iteration. Without a signature, a malicious browser extension / XSS /
 * replay could synthesize arbitrary `resume_state` payloads and trick the
 * route into running the LLM with a forged history.
 *
 * For CC's single-operator case this is moot — attacker can only mess with
 * their own session — but the production multi-tenant SaaS path needs the
 * defense. HMAC-SHA256 with a server-only secret turns resume_state into a
 * signed token: server signs on emit, server verifies on receipt, browser
 * is just a passthrough that cannot mint valid payloads.
 *
 * Env: CHAT_RESUME_HMAC_KEY (any ≥32 char string). Legacy name
 *      BRAVO_RESUME_HMAC_KEY honored as fallback during the
 *      transition window.
 *   Missing in production → fail closed (route returns 503). Missing in
 *   development → degraded "no signing" mode logs a warning but allows
 *   the flow to work without the secret, so dev setup doesn't require a
 *   new env var. Production deploys MUST set it.
 *
 * Canonicalization: keys sorted recursively so JSON.stringify variations
 * between Node versions / object construction orders don't produce
 * verification false-negatives.
