/**
 * oasis-default-sequences.ts — the starter drip sequences for the
 * OASIS HQ tenant (Phase 4.4 of the empire redesign).
 *
 * Cadence parallels the SunBiz pattern (lib/sunbiz-default-sequences.ts)
 * but the copy + funnel shape is OASIS-side: selling AI agent builds +
 * retainers to landlords, business owners, and agencies.
 *
 * Trigger events:
 *   BRAVO_RECORD_STATUS_CHANGED  — entity=lead, field=stage, to=<target>
 *
 * Channels:
 *   email — through send_gateway → Gmail. Respects CASL + 72h cooldown.
 *   sms   — disabled by default for OASIS today (no TT/Twilio number on
 *           the OASIS lane). When CC wires a number, flip enabled_on_seed
 *           on the SMS variants.
