/**
 * Seed manifests — in-code source of truth that mirrors the legacy
 * lib/client-profiles.ts registry. These are the manifests we serve when:
 *
 *   1. the `tenant_manifests` Supabase table is empty (fresh install), OR
 *   2. the DB is unreachable from a Vercel function for this request, OR
 *   3. the requested slug isn't in the DB but we want a sensible default.
 *
 * Once Phase 2's AI editor lands and writes to Supabase, seeds become the
 * "shipped defaults" — the DB row overrides per tenant. Until then, the seeds
 * ARE the manifests, just loaded through the same pipeline a DB-backed
 * manifest would use, so the cutover in 1b is a no-op for the renderer.

He runs cold outreach and brings ghosted deals back to the table — the same human-sounding cadence you'd send yourself, just faster.\n\n## Where leads come from\n\n- The **SunBiz application form** (built into the dashboard — see Forms). Personalized links go out by SMS or email; submissions land in Leads in the **Imported** column.\n- **Bulk CSV import** (see Import). Drop a Google Sheet export and Solara de-duplicates by email and phone before adding.\n- **Manual entry** from the Leads page → **+ New lead**.\n\n## Your day, end to end\n\n1. **Open the Dashboard.** Hot leads, missing-info alerts, and renewals due are at the top — that's your priority list.\n2. **Move leads through the pipeline.** Click any chevron stage to see who's there. Drag the hot ones to **Follow Up** and the 3-touch cadence fires automatically.\n3. **Send applications.** When a lead is ready, send them the application link from their detail page. Once they sign and upload bank statements, they graduate to the Opportunity Pipeline.\n4. **Shop the application out.** Open the application card and check **Recommended Lenders** — top fits by FICO, monthly revenue, and time in business. One click forwards the deal to a lender.\n5. **Log the offer.** When a lender returns terms, capture them in Offers. Click **Accept** and the deal rolls into Funded Deals as a draft.\n6. **Watch renewals.** Funded Deals shows the renewal window — anything 40-50% through term is your re-funding focus for the week.\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n- The **Automations** tab shows the scheduled jobs running on your computer — lead scoring, follow-up checks, daily briefs. You can describe a new one in plain English and your agent writes the script for you.\n- **Settings → Devices** is where you pair the local install. Once paired, the dashboard reads from your machine and your agents can run code in the background." } },
