            <strong className="text-fg">The warm process pool</strong> — keeps a hot Claude Code subprocess per chat tab. Max 8 processes, idle reaper at 15min. Skips the 5-30s cold-start on turn 2+. Live state visible at <code className="text-accent">/operations</code> &gt; Warm Process Pool, or <code className="text-accent">curl localhost:9100/warm-status</code>.

            <strong className="text-fg">The heartbeat</strong> — fires every 60s from the chat-server. Probes ffmpeg / whisper / playwright on the client&apos;s machine, posts the results to <code className="text-accent">/api/bridge/ping</code>. The dashboard&apos;s /integrations page reflects what&apos;s actually installed locally. All probes pass <code className="text-accent">creationflags=CREATE_NO_WINDOW + STARTUPINFO/SW_HIDE</code> — zero terminal popups even though <code className="text-accent">playwright.cmd</code> requires cmd.exe (commit 59d773c).

            <strong className="text-fg">The pair token</strong> — minted on first <code className="text-accent">bravo bridge serve</code>. Stored at <code className="text-accent">~/.oasis/bridge_token</code> (chmod 600 on Unix). SHA-256 hashed in the <code className="text-accent">bridge_pairings</code> table. Idempotent by <code className="text-accent">(tenant_id, machine_fingerprint)</code> via partial unique index — re-pairing rotates the token instead of creating duplicates.
