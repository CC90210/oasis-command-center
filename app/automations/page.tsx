          <p>
            <span className="text-fg font-bold">Where they run.</span> Each automation runs
            on YOUR computer, not the cloud. Your machine wakes up every minute, checks the
            schedule, and runs anything that&apos;s due — quietly in the background, no windows
            pop up, nothing leaves your laptop unless the job itself sends a message somewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="text-fg font-bold">What it costs.</span> Most jobs are free
            (pulling data, taking snapshots, syncing Stripe). The ones that cost something are
            the AI-powered ones — a daily summary written by Claude costs roughly 25¢; scoring
            a single lead costs about a penny. If a job sends emails or texts, that uses your
            Gmail or Twilio account directly. We don&apos;t add any markup.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="text-fg font-bold">Where the output ends up.</span> Three places,

          <ul className="ml-5 space-y-1.5 list-disc">
            <li>
              <span className="text-fg font-medium">Telegram</span> — for things you want a
              ping about: daily briefs, follow-up reminders, alerts when something needs your
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="text-fg font-medium">Files on your machine</span> — snapshot
              jobs save pre-computed data your agents read later (so the dashboard stays fast).
              No notification, just quietly available.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="text-fg font-medium">The dashboard itself</span> — scoring +
              sync jobs write back to your pipeline so Today / Pipeline / Health stay current.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span className="text-fg font-bold">Switching jobs on and off.</span> Each row
            has a toggle. Flip it off and the job stops firing within a minute — the spec
            stays saved so you can switch it back on later. No restart needed.
          </p>

            in the &quot;Describe an automation&quot; box below — &quot;Every Monday at 9am,
            text me a summary of last week&apos;s funded deals,&quot; that kind of thing.
            Your agent writes the script, shows you what it does, and saves it switched-off so
            nothing fires until you&apos;ve read it.

            Empire jobs (locked badge) come from <code className="font-mono text-fg-dim">scripts/cron_engine.py
            SEED_JOBS</code> and only the on/off toggle is operator-controlled —
            schedule + action stay locked to the code. Tenant jobs are
            anything you create via &quot;+ New automation&quot; — fully
            editable.
