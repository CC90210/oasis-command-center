  "/api/outbound/log",     // outbound logging from local backend (HMAC auth inside)
  // /api/event-feed removed from public allowlist 2026-05-18 (Codex
  // pass 4): payloads carry record IDs / lead context / command
  // summaries — not safe for unauthenticated callers. Route now

  "/api/track",            // Email-open tracking pixel (Phase 19 SunBiz CRM, 2026-05-17). Must be public — mail clients fetch the pixel without a session. Route resolves tenant_id by lookup against the interaction row (never trusts the URL parameter) and always returns a 1x1 GIF, so 401-gating it would silently break every operator's open-rate tracking. Migration 050 dedupes by (outbound_message_id, ip_hash) so a known reservation_id can't be replayed to inflate row counts.

  // /api/forms is intentionally NOT a public prefix — /api/forms (list),
  // /api/forms/[id] (CRUD), and /api/forms/[id]/mint-link are all
  // admin-only (session-authed). The two PUBLIC form endpoints below
  // are listed explicitly so middleware passes them through while
  // keeping the admin routes session-gated. Both authenticate via an
  // HMAC-signed token in the request body (NOT a session cookie) so
  // prospects can fill out the personalized form without an OASIS
  // account. Without these allowlist entries the entire public
  // application-form flow returns 401 — every inbound SunBiz lead
  // gets a broken form.
  "/api/forms/submit",     // POST per-step → inserts form_submissions row + maybe stage-transitions the lead.
  "/api/forms/view",       // POST on form-page mount → records form_views + fires viewed_application drip.
  "/f/",                   // Public prospect-facing form pages. Two shapes: /f/<tenant>/<form>/<lead_token> (personalized, HMAC-signed via Solara mint) and /f/<tenant>/<form> (anonymous share — server creates a fresh lead on submit). Both must be reachable without a session cookie or every inbound form return 401 — verified failure mode 2026-05-18 (CC opened a copied link in incognito and landed on /login).
